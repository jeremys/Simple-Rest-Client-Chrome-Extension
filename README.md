# Postman App Support

If you have a suggestion or an issue to report, please use this [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). We recommend that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This probably is the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add steps to reproduce the bug, Postman version, Chrome version and OS version. Any additonal files (collections, data dumps, console errors, screenshots) would be helpful. We have compiled a quick set of [guidelines for reporting issues](#guidelines-for-reporting-issues).

## Guidelines for reporting issues

We have put together a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). Following this should help speedy resolution of issues.

1. This issue tracker is only for Postman App related issues, along with other services accessible from the app.
  If you have Newman specific issues, a better place to report them would be the Newman issue tracker at [https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues)

2. If you are facing [Postman Cloud](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/cloud) related issue (such as sync, cloud-api, documenter, etc) and you want to include personal information such as your username or collection names, then mail us at [help@getpostman.com](mailto:help@getpostman.com).

3. Answer to questions along the lines of "How do I... in Postman" should be in our online documentation at [http://getpostman.com/docs](http://getpostman.com/docs). If you are unable to find a how-to guide in our online documentation, feel free to ask your question on our [Slack Community](#the-community).

4. Before reporting an issue use the search feature on the issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it is hard to keep track of them or respond when the issues are solved. If you find your issue already reported, feel free to add "+1" reaction and we will keep a note of it.

5. When reporting a new issue in the issue tracker, check whether it helps to answer the following questions:

   - Which Postman App, Chrome and Operating System version you are using. You can check this out in _Settings -> About_ section.

   - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally?

   - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?

   - If it is a UI issue, a screenshot or GIF will help tremendously. (Tip: For quick gifs, check out [http://www.cockos.com/licecap/](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/))

   - Do you have the [Postman Interceptor](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/capture) switched on? (applicable for the Chrome app)

   - If the request/response flow is not working, be sure to check and include details from the DevTools window (More on this at [https://www.getpostman.com/docs/errors](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/errors)).
